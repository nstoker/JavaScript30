# JavaScript30

A course to aid in learning clean JavaScript avoiding the use of libraries.

Muscle memory is important, getting used to typing the code while you're adding it aids learning. You can get the videos from [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com).

[Starter Files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) + Completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge. You can jump straight to the completed code, but doing that means you won't have thought through the code.
