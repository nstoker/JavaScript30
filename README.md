# JavaScript30

A course to aid in learning clean JavaScript avoiding the use of libraries.

Muscle memory is important, getting used to typing the code while you're adding it aids learning. You can get the videos from [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com).

[Starter Files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) + Completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge. You can jump straight to the completed code, but doing that means you won't have thought through the code.

Gets data using `fetch` from the internet, filters using a regex to get matching cities/states, then inserts a string containing selected parts of the matches.

This feels like the first useful task on the course.

At 16:40 The highlight isn't working in the city/state names.
